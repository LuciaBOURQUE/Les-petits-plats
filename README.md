# Les petits plats

8's project of Openclassrooms

Les petits plats is a cooking company which is launching its own website listing a set of cooking recipes.
The objective of the mission here is to implement the search functionality mainly in Javascript from a predefined model while placing a point of honor on the notion of performance. The company wants two versions of the search algorithm so it can decide which one it prefers; either a version using native loops (while, for...) or a functional programming version with array object methods (foreach, filter, map, reduce).
You can navigate between the different branches to compare the two methods.
